# Visual ML

Machine learning is becoming more and more popular every day. However, learning machine learning can often be a very difficult task. Newcomers are presented with a lot of math, programming, and complicated concepts, distracting them from understanding the basics.

The Visual ML project aims to solve this problem. It allows users to visualize the fundamentals of machine learning in a simple interface. It anyone to create, train, and test neural networks, without any previous knowledge of math or programming.

## How it works
